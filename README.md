photo-cleanup
=============

photo-cleanup is a photo organizer.

To move all images from source to target directory while at the same time
organizing them into /dest/<YEAR>/filename.ext structure, simply execute:

    photo-cleanup organize /media/SDCARD /home/me/Photos

photo-cleanup is configured with common defaults, to ignore all hidden and
non-image files. However, it supports multiple options to change destination
directory structure, allow hidden and non-image files and many others.

# No Warranty

Please note that photo-cleanup comes with no warranty. I use it to manage my
photos, but I am sure that some bugs have sneaked through. Backup your photos
before letting photo-cleanup lose.
